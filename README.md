# About

## Based on
This is an experiment based on the game *Zarch* and the subsequent game *Virus 2000*.  
I'm aiming to make an almost infinite procedurally created world that you can fly over and maybe something resembling a game in the future

## How to play
A playable version can be found at https://www.atollski.com/above
*Mouse wheel* Roll up and down to change vertical thrust  
*Mouse left/right* Yaw the vehicle left/right  
*Mouse up/down* Pitch the vehicle forwards and back  
*Mouse wheel left/right* Roll the vehicle  
*Any key* Switch vehicles if more than one is available

## Engine
This is an experiment using *THREE.js* for graphics and *ammo.js* (based on bullet physics) for the physics.  
It is based on an excellent tutorial by **bluemagnificent** at https://medium.com/@bluemagnificent/intro-to-javascript-3d-physics-using-ammo-js-and-three-js-dd48df81f591

Currently the world height map is generated by a Perlin noise generator.
